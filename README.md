🎯 Phishing Simulation using GoPhish & Mailtrap

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship at **Internee.pk**. The objective was to simulate a phishing attack using **GoPhish** and **Mailtrap** (as an SMTP relay) due to restricted access to external SMTP services. The campaign mimics a corporate phishing attempt through a fake HR email and landing page.

📌 Objective

- Simulate a realistic phishing campaign targeting employees.
- Track delivery, opens, and clicks using GoPhish.
